<h2>Cats</h2>
<p>
<img src="cat1.png" alt="Cat picture" style="width:30%;height:30%;"/>
<br>Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United States. 
<br>While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and diet can differ between breeds. 
<br>However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.
</p>

<p>
<h1>Zero to Four Weeks</h1>
<br>It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible. 
<br>Monitor your kittenâ€™s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is progressing steadily. 
<br>If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. 
<br>Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the following:
<li>too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk
<li>gastrointestinal disease
<li>environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions
</p>

<p>
<h1>Four Weeks to One Year</h1>
<br>Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after birth. 
<br>According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips"> ASPCA</a>, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. 
<br>If your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. 
<br>Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. 
<br>Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements.
<br>You should always consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.
</p>

<h1>One Year to Seven Years</h1>
<br>This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. 
<br>At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. 
<br>It is <b>not</b> recommended to leave food out for the cats all day. 
<br>Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout the day. 
<br>This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.
</p>

<p>
<h1>Seven Years and More</h1>
<br>Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. 
<br>Cats at this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. 
<br>This means when you are purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and <b>not</b> just a category (such as fish). 
<br>This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality proteins.
